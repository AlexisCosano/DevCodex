Controls

- A = Move left
- D = Move right
- Space = Jump

When in God mode:

- A = Move left
- W = Move up
- S = Move down
- D = Move right

Debug
- F1 = Load first map
- F2 = Load second map
- F3 = Restart the current map
- F5 = Save current state
- F6 = Load saved state
- F9 = Debug mode
- F10 = God mode

Goal = get to the end of the level, it's lineal so, you'll eventually find it. (Hint: if you see boxes, it means that the level is coming to an end!)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Known issues:

- The parallax creates some minor artifacts in some specific cases.
- There are no sound effects (yet!).

Music used: Mimiga Town, from Cave Story. I do not own this song, Cave Story is owned by Studio Pixel.

The sprites used come directly from our own games, made by Martí Pinós Melo and Sergi Pérez Crespo.
