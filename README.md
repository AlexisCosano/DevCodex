# Monster Heights
2D platform game made with my own 2D game engine.
Made by [Alexis Cosano](https://github.com/AlexisCosano).

IMPORTANT: in some laptops, they game doesn't display well due to the laptop's resolution (or maybe you feel like you're missing something from the environment). If that's the case, open the config.xml, and under <window> -> <options>, change resizable="false" into resizable="true". Once you open the game, maximize the window, and it should display everything.

Keep in mind that you will see the black background and some more imperfections as the game hasn't been designed to show those parts, but at least it will display everything correctly if the resolution is low.

Goal = get to the end of the level, it's lineal so, you'll eventually find it. (Hint: if you see boxes, it means that the level is coming to an end!)

Known issues:

- The parallax creates some minor artifacts in some specific cases.
- There are no sound effects (yet!).
- You cannot win while using God mode at the moment.
- It's lacking feedback, but it will improve soon!
